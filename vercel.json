Click **Commit changes**. Vercel will auto-redeploy in ~30 seconds and your site will load.

If it still shows 404 after that, also check that your `index.html` is in the **root of the repo** (not inside a folder). It should look like this in GitHub:
```
karat-farmer/
├── index.html
└── vercel.json
